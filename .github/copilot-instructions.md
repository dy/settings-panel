The goal of the project is panel with controls designed for purpose that _feel right_.

Important project decisions are documented in .work/research.md in particular style:

```md
## [ ] question (with alternatives) -> decision
  0. core option
    + argument for 1
    + argument for 2
    ...
    - against 1
    - against 2
    ...
  1. alternative
    + pro
    - cons
  ...
## [ ] question (just decision) -> decision
  * Point 1
  * Point 2
  ...
```

Be frugal with descriptions, don't get too verbose or detailed - show key insights/points.
