# AI WORKING AGREEMENT

The goal is panel with controls designed for purpose that _feel right_.

Source of truth:
- `.work/todo.md` — roadmap + progress. Do not invent tasks.
- `.work/research.md` — vision, constraints, decisions.
- `docs/*` – aspects.

Rules:
- If unclear or missing, ask. Do not guess.
- Prefer deletion over expansion.
- Respect existing decisions unless told to revise.

If not written, it is undecided.
