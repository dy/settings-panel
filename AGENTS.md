# AI WORKING AGREEMENT

This project uses a minimal planning framework.

Source of truth:
- `.work/todo.md` — roadmap + progress (checkboxes). Do not invent tasks.
- `.work/research.md` — vision, constraints, decisions, open questions.

Rules:
- Do not add features, structure, or abstractions not grounded in these files.
- If something is unclear or missing, ask instead of guessing.
- Prefer deletion and simplification over expansion.
- Respect existing constraints and decisions unless explicitly told to revise them.

Assumption policy:
- No implicit tech, UX, or scope assumptions.
- If it is not written, it is undecided.
