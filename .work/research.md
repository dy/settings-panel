## Vision

* Parameter controls that are presentation-ready, not just functional.
* Each combination of any theme params should look beautiful
* Controls designed for purpose that _feel right_.
	* Log slider that *is* logarithmic
	* Palette picker that *understands* color
	* XY pad with pointerlock precision
	* Waveform display that *knows* audio
	* Font picker that *knows* font

## Principles

	* Quality > quantity
	* Each type crafted for its purpose
	* Resist feature-count pressure
	* No React lock-in, no plugin ecosystem complexity

## Technical Direction

	* Signals-based reactivity
	* 0 dependencies
	* Framework-agnostic (vanilla JS, sprae-compatible)
	* Open, minimal API
