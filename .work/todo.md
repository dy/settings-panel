## [ ] MVP

* [x] Theme: default (size calibrator)
  * [x] width bug
  * [x] inverse color logic
  * [x] disable inactive axes

## Cases

* [ ] Figma
* [ ] dat.gui+
* [ ] Apples
* [ ] refactoring.ui
* [ ]

## Ideas

* [ ] contrast = roundness contrast as well? (rounded button, square shape)
* [ ] breath: pulse on focused controls, shadow oscillation on hover
* [ ] spring?: sliders overshoot
* [ ] reflected light?
* [ ] canonical internal structure (form)
  * [ ] produced HTML/theme can be used for generic forms design
  * [ ] minimal base.css generator for websites
