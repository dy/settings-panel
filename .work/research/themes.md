## [ ] Theme Taxonomy (Design Philosophies)

Themes define HOW things look — the visual language, not the colors.
Mode defines WHAT colors. They're orthogonal.

## Historical Movements → Interface Design

### BAUHAUS (1919–1933)
*"Form follows function."*

**Philosophy:** Unity of art and craft. Geometry as language. Primary colors as vocabulary. The machine aesthetic celebrated, not hidden.

**Visual DNA:**
- Primary colors (red, yellow, blue) + black/white
- Geometric primitives: circle, square, triangle
- Asymmetric balance
- Sans-serif typography (Futura, geometric)
- Grid as skeleton, not decoration

**Examples:** Wassily chair, Bauhaus Dessau building, Herbert Bayer posters
**Interface echoes:** Early iOS icons (geometric), Windows Phone tiles, Google Material icons

**Rules:**
- Shapes are fundamental: circles, squares, triangles
- Color is structural, not decorative
- Asymmetry creates tension and hierarchy
- No ornament — the form IS the content

---

### SWISS / International Typographic Style (1950s–60s)
*"Content, not decoration."*

**Philosophy:** Objective clarity. The grid as organizing principle. Typography as architecture. The designer is invisible — the content speaks.

**Visual DNA:**
- Mathematical grids
- Sans-serif (Helvetica, Univers, Akzidenz)
- Asymmetric layouts
- Photography over illustration
- Generous whitespace
- Flush-left, ragged-right text

**Lineage:** Josef Müller-Brockmann, Max Bill, Massimo Vignelli, Dieter Rams
**Brands:** Braun, Vitsœ, Apple (post-2013), Stripe, Linear, FabFilter, Figma
**Associations:** German engineering, precision, honesty, trust

**Rules:**
- The grid is sacred
- Borders are informational, not decorative
- Shadows are functional (focus states only)
- Typography carries all hierarchy
- Whitespace is active, not empty
- If it doesn't communicate, remove it

---

### ART DECO (1920s–30s)
*"Geometric elegance."*

**Philosophy:** Luxury through geometry. Machine-age optimism. Ornament that earns its place through mathematical beauty.

**Visual DNA:**
- Symmetry and repetition
- Sunburst/radiating patterns
- Stepped forms (ziggurat)
- Gold, silver, black lacquer
- Geometric serif typography
- Fan shapes, chevrons

**Examples:** Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center, Tamara de Lempicka paintings
**Associations:** Jazz age, cinema, luxury, gatsby

**Rules:**
- Symmetry is power
- Metallics signal quality
- Geometry can be ornamental if mathematical
- Vertical emphasis suggests aspiration
- Borders can be decorative if patterned

---

### MID-CENTURY MODERN (1945–1969)
*"Optimistic functionalism."*

**Philosophy:** Democratic design. Technology serves humanity. Organic meets geometric. The home as sanctuary.

**Visual DNA:**
- Organic curves + geometric structure
- Natural materials (wood, leather, wool)
- Warm neutrals + accent colors
- Tapered legs, floating forms
- Exposed structure (honest construction)

**Lineage:** Eames, Saarinen, Noguchi, Jacobsen
**Brands:** Herman Miller, Knoll, Bang & Olufsen
**Associations:** Space age, California, Danish hygge

**Rules:**
- Warmth through materials, not decoration
- Structure can be visible and beautiful
- Curves soften but don't obscure
- Color is accent, not cacophony

---

### TERMINAL / Utilitarian (1970s–now)
*"Information density over polish."*

**Philosophy:** Every pixel earns its place. Decoration is waste. Speed is respect. The interface disappears into the task.

**Visual DNA:**
- Monospace typography
- 1px borders or none
- High information density
- Color = status (green=ok, red=error, yellow=warn)
- No gradients, no shadows
- Hard edges, no radius

**Lineage:** VT100, Bloomberg Terminal, vim, htop
**Brands:** Bloomberg, Ableton Live, Elektron, JetBrains
**Associations:** Trading floors, hacker culture, power users, efficiency

**Rules:**
- Monospace is the only font
- Animation is instant or absent
- Color is semantic, never decorative
- Density = power
- No rounded corners
- 1px borders maximum

---

### INDUSTRIAL / Teenage Engineering (2000s–now)
*"Exposed honesty."*

**Philosophy:** Show the work. The machine is beautiful because it's a machine. Utility is the aesthetic. Playfulness in restraint.

**Visual DNA:**
- Exposed screws, PCB traces, raw materials
- High-visibility accents (orange, yellow)
- Modular, reconfigurable
- Rubberized, tactile surfaces
- Industrial typography (DIN, Eurostile)
- Function labels as decoration

**Lineage:** Teenage Engineering, Nothing Phone, industrial equipment, Braun (early)
**Brands:** Teenage Engineering, Nothing, Analogue, field recorders
**Associations:** Makers, synth nerds, Scandinavian design, modularity

**Rules:**
- Structure is visible
- Accent color is functional (danger, interaction)
- Labels are literal ("POWER", "SYNC")
- Modularity over integration
- Tactile feedback matters
- Imperfection is honest

---

### SKEUOMORPHISM / Analog (2007–2013)
*"The world before screens."*

**Philosophy:** Digital should feel physical. Metaphors reduce cognitive load. The familiar is welcoming.

**Visual DNA:**
- Realistic textures (leather, wood, felt, metal)
- Directional lighting, consistent shadows
- Physical affordances (buttons that press, pages that turn)
- Gradients that suggest dimension
- Bevels, embossing, reflections

**Lineage:** iOS 1–6, Waves Audio plugins, Universal Audio, vintage audio gear
**Brands:** Universal Audio, Waves, Apple (2007–2013), old iOS
**Associations:** Nostalgia, analog warmth, recording studios, craftsmanship

**Rules:**
- Light source is consistent (usually top-left)
- Shadows are realistic (blur, spread, direction)
- Textures suggest specific materials
- Buttons look pressable
- Knobs look turnable
- Metaphors should be recognizable

---

### FLAT DESIGN (2012–2017)
*"Honest digital."*

**Philosophy:** Screens are screens. No fake depth. Content over chrome. Bold color, bold typography.

**Visual DNA:**
- Solid colors, no gradients
- No shadows or depth
- Geometric icons
- Bold sans-serif typography
- Color blocks define hierarchy
- Minimal borders

**Lineage:** Windows 8 Metro, iOS 7, early Material Design
**Brands:** Microsoft (Metro era), iOS 7–10, Spotify (early)
**Associations:** Modernism redux, clarity, digital-native

**Rules:**
- No gradients
- No shadows
- No textures
- Color is the only hierarchy tool
- Typography must be strong
- Icons are geometric primitives

---

### MATERIAL DESIGN (2014–now)
*"Paper in digital space."*

**Philosophy:** Surfaces are paper. Depth through elevation. Motion is meaningful. Bold color, intentional.

**Visual DNA:**
- Elevation shadows (multiple layers)
- Paper-like surfaces that stack
- Ripple effects on touch
- 8dp grid
- Bold accent colors
- Roboto typography

**Lineage:** Google Material Design, Android
**Brands:** Google, Android apps, many web apps
**Associations:** Android, Google, motion design

**Rules:**
- Shadows indicate elevation (not light source)
- Surfaces never pass through each other
- Motion has meaning (entry, exit, emphasis)
- Color is systematic (primary, secondary, surface)
- Touch ripples from touch point

---

### NEUMORPHISM / Soft UI (2019–2020)
*"Soft extrusion."*

**Philosophy:** Elements push out of or sink into the surface. Same-material depth. Subtle, not dramatic.

**Visual DNA:**
- Paired shadows (dark + light)
- Same-color surfaces
- Extremely rounded corners
- Low contrast
- Soft, muted colors
- No borders

**Lineage:** Dribbble concepts, Alexander Plyuto's explorations
**Brands:** (Few production uses — accessibility issues)
**Associations:** Soft plastic, clay, quiet luxury

**Rules:**
- Shadows always paired (dark bottom-right, light top-left)
- Background and elements are same color family
- Roundness is very high
- Contrast is dangerously low (accessibility!)
- No sharp edges anywhere

---

### GLASSMORPHISM (2020–now)
*"Layered translucency."*

**Philosophy:** Depth through blur, not shadow. Surfaces are frosted glass. Context bleeds through.

**Visual DNA:**
- Background blur (frosted glass)
- Subtle white/light borders
- Transparency/opacity
- Floating layers
- Vivid backgrounds (the blur needs something to blur)
- Thin strokes

**Lineage:** macOS Big Sur, Windows 11, iOS 15+ widgets
**Brands:** Apple (Big Sur+), Windows 11, many modern apps
**Associations:** Premium, modern, airy, depth

**Rules:**
- Blur is the primary depth cue
- Borders are thin, often white/light
- Background must be interesting (blur of nothing = nothing)
- Transparency varies by layer
- Works best with vibrant backgrounds

---

### NEOBRUTALISM (2021–now)
*"Raw, bold, anti-polish."*

**Philosophy:** Reject smoothness. Visible structure. High contrast. Playful confrontation.

**Visual DNA:**
- Hard shadows (offset, no blur)
- Thick black borders
- High saturation colors
- Raw, sometimes clashing palettes
- Visible grid structure
- Bold, sometimes quirky typography

**Lineage:** Gumroad redesign, Figma marketing, indie web

- Shadows are hard offset (e.g., 4px 4px 0 black)
- Borders are thick (2-4px) and always black
- Colors can clash — that's the point
- No gradients
- No blur
- Structure is visible and celebrated

---

### CLASSIC / Editorial (timeless)
*"The book as interface."*

**Philosophy:** Centuries of print wisdom. Hierarchy through typography. Restraint is elegance.

**Visual DNA:**

**Associations:** Reading, writing, scholarship, timelessness

**Rules:**
- Serif is default
- Line length is controlled (~66 characters)
- Whitespace is generous
- Color is minimal (text + one accent)
- Hierarchy through size and weight, not color
- Ornament is typographic (rules, small caps)

---

### MINIMALISM (eternal)
*"Less, but better."*

**Philosophy:** Reduction to essence. Only what's necessary. Space is presence.

**Visual DNA:**
- Maximum whitespace
- Single accent color (or none)
- Thin lines or none
- Geometric sans-serif
- Asymmetric balance
- Hidden complexity

**Lineage:** Dieter Rams, John Pawson, Apple (post-Ive)
**Brands:** Apple, Muji, Aesop, Linear

## Proposed Theme Set (Refined)

For settings-panel, these 8 cover the meaningful territory:

| Theme | Philosophy | Iconic Reference | Key Visual |
|-------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| **swiss** | Invisible design | Braun, Stripe | Grids, no shadows, functional borders |
| **terminal** | Information density | Bloomberg, vim | Monospace, 1px, no radius |
| **industrial** | Exposed honesty | Teenage Engineering | Visible structure, accent color |

### What we're NOT including (and why):
- **Bauhaus** — Absorbed into Swiss (same DNA, less pure)
- **Art Deco** — Too ornamental for utility interfaces
- **Material** — Too Google-specific, shadow model conflicts
- **Flat** — Swiss covers this territory
- **Mid-Century** — More furniture than interface
